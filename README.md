# TripWireDisarmer
**English** | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

Allows you to use shears to make tripwire disarmed+powered, which can be used to make tripwire (string) duplicators in NeoForge.

### Features

* This mod does not modify existing modifications made by NeoForge (left-clicking on tripwires to remove them directly), but instead implements the vanilla behavior by adding additional operations to shears;
* For making special tripwires, simulate the vanilla behavior as much as possible;

### How to Use

1. Install this mod;
2. Hold shears (or an item with the `#c:tools/shear` tag) and **right-click** on the connected tripwire;
3. Done!
